# LogLog Spectrum

When you open fb2k and see the spectrum, do you really know what it is?

We think no one knows that.

First, it does not have axis ticks; then the axis of frequency is also 
hard to read.

Hence we present loglog spectrum, which uses log frequency as its axis.

Why? Because music are naturally presented by ratios, then logarithm is
a natural choice.
